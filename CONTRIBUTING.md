### Thank you! 
Thank you for contributing to our resources.

### Guidelines
1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes. This is important as it allows you to separate your changes from the main branch, making it easier for the project maintainers to review and merge your changes.
4. Make your changes and commit them to the branch you created.
5. The resource must be completely free or to have a free tier.

### Once again thank you ðŸ¤˜
